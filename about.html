									<h1>Who am I?</h1>

								<div class="image left"><img src="images/AnotherPicOfMe.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Within my younger years I spent most of my free time playing video games on a wide range of different platforms such as GameBoy, DS to Playstation and Xbox and eventually to PC. The time spent playing games were always loved as being able to disconnect from the real world and becoming so engrossed within different worlds and characters that hours would fly past creating an indescribable feeling of euphoria and from this I knew I wanted to be able to provide this for other people. </p>
								<p>My Interest for Software Development came from my Father and time spent within school, of course not being able to try much game development apart from Scratch creating my first simple game. Building my base programming skills through School through learning Visual Basic to create simple applications such as basic display atm password recognition to a calculator. From this I knew I wanted to try and learn to program in order to create games. </p>

								<p>Throughout my education within University I have grown my confidence with C based languages with my strongest being C# with multiple projects with the language, however core transferable skills were learned within C++ from creating a working game engine with a simple shooter built on top. Further experience has also been gained through mobile development from building android applications using combinations of HTML, CSS, Java and Javascript.</p>
								<p>I have a strong passion for trying to improve upon my work through iterative development, I enjoy learning and experimenting with different game AI techniques.</p>
